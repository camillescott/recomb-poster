**Background:** With sequencing experiments regularly reaching into the billions of fragments, 
assembly graphs have become a core feature of most extant assemblers. Traversals of these 
graphs yield images of the underlying sequence, and the assembled sequences that 
result are studied in downstream analyses. However, less studied are features of the assembly graph itself. Motivated by the observation that assembly graphs succinctly encode a universe of possible assemblies, we explore some fundamental features of assembly graphs from RNA-seq. Our work is guided by the question: how much sequence is needed to build a reliable and useful image of the underlying transcripts? Using a large body of RNA-seq experiments available through the Marine Microbial Eukaryotic Sequencing Project (MMETSP), we describe transcriptome assembly graphs though their component size and coverage distributions, and harness this information to present a model for streaming transcriptome assembly graph partitioning. This work moves us toward our goal of producing a fully streaming transcriptome assembler.

### **Methods**

#### Software

These analyses are implemented in the `boink` package (https://github.com/camillescott/boink), which is
built on the `khmer/oxli` package [@khmer] from the Lab for Data Intensive Biology
(http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/) at UCD.

#### Streaming Partitioning


### **Results**

#### RNA-seq assembly graphs are dominated by a highly connected component

Early work showed that assembly graphs from RNA-seq data tend to become dominated by one highly connected
component, even when error trimming and adapter removal is performed. This component, which we call
the "lump," is composed of low complexity sequence and high-degree nodes.

#### Assembly Graphs Stabilize Early

#### Component Coverage help minimize traversals



### **Discussion**


```{r new-standard}
# Get reference image
download.file(
  "https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png", mode = "wb",
  destfile = "../output/img/standards.png"
)
```


Since there are so many tools that can be used to prepare posters,
and not a single one satisfies my needs,
I prepared this *other* tool to... nah it still is missing things.

#### Limitations

Since the png file is generated as a snapshot of the html poster,
several limitations should be considered:

- Resolution is very limited by the resources in your system
- Larger formats require much more resources to render
- Complex posters can take longer to load, so you have to try different delays
- The preview shown in `poster/poster_frame.html` could be very different to
the final rendered image
- "I can't fit enough text/figures!"  
  ↑ that one's on you, nobody likes a crammed poster
